# Memory Pool Performance Results

> **Last Updated**: Awaiting first benchmark run
> **Auto-generated by**: GitHub Actions

This document contains auto-generated performance benchmark results for the memory pool implementation. Results are updated automatically when benchmarks run in CI/CD.

## About These Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks are run automatically on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests modifying memory pool code
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Platforms Tested
- **Ubuntu 22.04** (x86_64, GCC/Clang)
- **macOS latest** (ARM64, Apple Silicon)

### Benchmark Categories

1. **Basic Allocation**: Pool vs standard allocator for various block sizes
2. **Batch Operations**: Sequential batch allocations
3. **Concurrent Performance**: Multi-threaded allocation scaling
4. **Real-World Patterns**: Web server and parser simulation patterns
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Cache efficiency and fragmentation impact

## Latest Results

> Results will be populated automatically by GitHub Actions after the first benchmark run.

To trigger a benchmark run manually:
1. Go to Actions → Memory Pool Performance Benchmarks
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Results will be updated in this file automatically

## How to Interpret Results

### Time Metrics
- **Time (ns)**: CPU time per operation in nanoseconds
- **Lower is better**: Smaller values indicate faster operations

### Speedup Factor
- **Nx faster**: Pool allocation time compared to standard allocator
- Example: "10x faster" means pool is 10 times faster

### Performance Thresholds

| Block Size | Expected Speedup | Status |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| 64B | 10-50x faster | Target for small blocks |
| 256B | 5-20x faster | Good performance |
| 1KB | 2-10x faster | Moderate benefit |
| 4KB+ | 1-5x faster | Diminishing returns |

## Viewing Historical Results

Benchmark results are stored as artifacts for 90 days:
1. Go to Actions → Memory Pool Performance Benchmarks
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download artifacts: `memory-pool-results-ubuntu-22.04` or `memory-pool-results-macos-latest`
4. JSON format for detailed analysis

## Performance Goals

### Short-term Goals (Current Phase)
- ✅ Establish baseline measurements
- ✅ Validate pool is faster than standard allocator
- 🎯 Achieve 10x+ speedup for small blocks (<256B)

### Long-term Goals
- 🎯 Maintain performance across platforms
- 🎯 Detect performance regressions in CI
- 🎯 Optimize hot paths identified by benchmarks
